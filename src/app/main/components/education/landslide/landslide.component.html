<h1>Landslides and Safety Precautions</h1>
<p>
  India's geographical features, especially the Himalayas, have a significant
  impact on natural disasters like landslides and earthquakes. The collision
  between the Indian and Eurasian plates creates continuous stress on the rocks,
  making them susceptible to these events. The northward movement of the Indian
  plate at about 5 cm/year is a primary factor in accumulating stress, leading
  to natural disasters.
</p>
<p>
  Landslides are a common hazard in various parts of India, including the
  Himalayas, Northeastern hill ranges, Western Ghats, Nilgiris, Eastern Ghats,
  and the Vindhyas, affecting about 15% of the country's landmass. The
  Himalayas, in particular, experience a wide variety of landslides, from quick
  and massive ones to slow and creeping types. The Northeastern region,
  especially places like Darjeeling, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, is also
  prone to severe landslides that result in recurring economic losses.
</p>
<p>
  To mitigate the impact of landslides, the Government of India has implemented
  measures like Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) maps, which identify areas prone
  to landslides. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) provides
  guidelines for landslides and snow avalanches.

<h2>Landslide: Do's & Don'ts</h2>
<h3>Do's</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prepare tours to hilly regions according to information given by the weather
    department or news channels.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move away from the landslide path or downstream valleys quickly without
    wasting time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep drains clean and inspect them for litter, leaves, plastic bags, rubble,
    etc.
  </li>
  <li>Keep the weep holes open.</li>
  <li>Grow more trees that can hold the soil through their roots.</li>
  <li>
    Identify areas of rock fall, subsidence of buildings, and cracks that
    indicate landslides, and move to safer areas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contact the nearest Tehsil or District Headquarters if you notice muddy
    river waters indicating landslides upstream.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that the toe of the slope is not cut and remains protected; don't
    uproot trees unless re-vegetation is planned.
  </li>
  <li>
    Listen for unusual sounds such as trees cracking or boulders knocking
    together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay alert, awake, and active during the impact or probability of impact.
  </li>
  <li>
    Locate and go to shelters, and try to stay with your family and companions.
  </li>
  <li>Check for injured and trapped persons.</li>
  <li>
    Mark the path of your tracking so that you don't get lost in the middle of
    the forest.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know how to give signs or communicate during emergency times to helicopters
    and rescue teams.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Don'ts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid construction and staying in vulnerable areas.</li>
  <li>Do not panic and lose energy by crying.</li>
  <li>
    Do not touch or walk over loose material and electrical wiring or poles.
  </li>
  <li>Do not build houses near steep slopes and near drainage paths.</li>
  <li>
    Do not drink contaminated water directly from rivers, springs, or wells;
    rainwater collected directly is fine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not move an injured person without rendering first aid unless the
    casualty is in immediate danger.
  </li>
</ul>
